# Mac-Android-phone-remote
First you install qt scrcpy and mirror your phone. Then you run a Teamviewer or Remote Desktop and run the server on the Qt scrcpy window. Finally you use the
Teamviewer remote or RDR viewer on Iphone or Android. The versatility is awesome. When I tested it only had one device it messed my computer. I needed a remote because of my other repository Android 64bit DTS. I have to keep that phone plugged into my stereo. Download is through my Onedrive repository is too large to upload as a single file. Enjoy!



Best regards Ryan Johnson
